# Quorum

This project is an investigation of advanced semantic database that allow easy manipulation and human-like understanding.
Many of the commands are similar to the SQL select command

Basically, this type of database makes pattern/symbol manipulation very simple.
Simple pattern/symbol manipulation is good for making cognitive-science based AI.

I'll add more description in the future, I promise ;)
